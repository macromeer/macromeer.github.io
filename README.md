## About Me

I help scientists understand how cells grow and heal tissues by combining computer science, biology, and imaging. My work uses automated software and advanced microscopes to study regeneration, especially in the heart. I share my tools openly to support researchers and students.

## What I Do
- Build computer programs that turn microscope images into useful data
- Help explain how cells work together in healing and forming organs
- Teach others to use digital tools in biology

## Current Projects
- Studying tissue repair in zebrafish to learn about the human heart
- Creating open-source tools for image analysis and research collaboration

## Recent Achievements
- Awarded a University of Bern grant for innovative heart research (2024)
- Developed publicly available tools making scientific analysis easier
