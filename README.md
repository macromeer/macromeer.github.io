## About Me
I help biologists and physicians explore how cells organize and repair tissues. My work focuses on developing computational tools that transform advanced microscopy data into quantitative insights. I also train researchers and students to apply these tools to their own biological questions.

## What I Do
- Develop software that converts complex microscopy images into meaningful measurements
- Guide scientists in using state-of-the-art image analysis methods for their research

## Current Projects
- Investigating tissue regeneration in zebrafish as a model for human heart repair
- Building open-source tools to advance image analysis and collaborative research

## Recent Achievements
- Recipient of the 2024 University of Bern Initiator Grant
- Integrated deep learning models into large-scale image processing pipelines
