## About Me

I am a computational biophysicist who combines computer science with biophysics to answer complex biological questions. I develop specialized computer programs that analyze microscope images of cells and tissues, helping researchers understand how biological cells interact to form and maintain a biological tissue. Currently, I am creating and applying automated tools to study how the tissues of the zebrafish heart can heal after injury — research that can eventually help us understand how human hearts can heal better.

My work bridges the gap between detailed microscope images and mechanisms that explain cell behavior. This combination helps scientists gain deeper insights into the biological processes of tissue development and regeneration.

### Bio-Image Analysis
I develop custom software tools that extract meaningful information from microscope images:
- Processing raw images to enhance their quality
- Identifying and measuring specific features within cells and tissues
- Converting visual data into numbers that can be analyzed statistically

### Technical Expertise
I work with a variety of programming languages and specialized scientific tools:
- Python (with libraries for numerical analysis, image processing, and deep learning)
- Napari (an open-source tool for multi-dimensional image visualization)
- ImageJ/Fiji (widely-used biomedical image analysis software)
- Version control systems for collaborative software development

### Imaging Technologies
I work with data from advanced microscopy techniques:
- Lightsheet microscopy (for 3D imaging of living samples)
- Confocal microscopy (for high-resolution cellular imaging)
- Live imaging (for studying dynamic processes over time)
- Electron microscopy (for ultra-detailed structural analysis)

### Modeling & Analysis
I create computational models that help explain biological processes:
- Building mathematical representations of cellular systems
- Analyzing patterns in biological data
- Estimating parameters that drive biological processes
- Testing models against experimental data
