## About Me
I help biologists and physicians understand cell-based tissue processes. I create tools to quantify advanced microscopy data and train researchers and students to apply these tools in their quantification problem.

## What I Do
- Build computer programs that turn advanced microscopy images into useful data
- Teach others to use advanced image analysis tools in biology

## Current Projects
- Studying tissue repair in zebrafish to learn about the human heart
- Creating open-source tools for image analysis and research collaboration

## Recent Achievements
- University of Bern Initiator Grant 2024
- Implemented deep learning models in batch processing pipelines

## Get in Touch
